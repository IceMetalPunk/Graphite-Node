## Graphite: Battle's Edge
### By IceMetalPunk
Graphite is a 1-vs-1, arcade-style PvP game. The concept is a little fluid at the moment, but the basic idea will be taking inspiration from the long-defunct MMO(Puzzle)RPG called DownWorld, created by Flowplay, Inc. Players will battle one-on-one, using turn-based puzzle minigames to determine their attacks. As a fan of DownWorld, and someone who misses it, I decided to carry on its legacy in spirit without simply remaking someone else's game.

There may also be some elements of Sean Howard's ["Three Hundred Mechanics" blog](http://www.squidi.net/three/by_year.php), specifically his ["Branching Deathmatch"](http://www.squidi.net/three/entry.php?id=139) idea, if it actually works out and fits. At the very least, that inspired the game's name.

### Long-Term Plans
There may ultimately be ways of gaining experience, upgrading your character (in appearance as well as combat attributes), and (if a miracle allows me to take it this far) an adventure, exploration, or story mode.

### Licence?
For now, there's no license. I retain all rights to the game, including any code, assets, or ideas that originated with me. As development continues, I may change that and make it more open-source, but that remains to be determined.
